We present analysis of the sky background at the MMT Observatory using sky fiber data from
the Hectospec multi-fiber spectrograph. The natural sky background is highly variable and
PCA-based techniques are used to model and subtract this. The resulting residual spectra are
then used to explore more subtle features and long-term trends in the artificial sky background.

The data we analyze span from 2004 through 2021. Several features due to artificial lighting show
clear evolution during this time period. Most notably, a broad "bump" around 4500 A begins
appearing in the data in 2017. This coincides with the City of Tucson beginning their migration of
most street lighting to LEDs. The bump is apparent at all airmasses and azimuths. This shows that while
LED lighting is very energy efficient, its impacts can range quite far and into spectral regions that
previously had quite low background levels.
